            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This paper presents XBG (eXteroceptive Behaviour Generation), a multimodal end-to-end Imitation Learning (IL) system for a whole-body autonomous humanoid robot used in real-world Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios.
                The main contribution of this paper is an architecture for learning HRI behaviors using a data-driven approach. 
                Through teleoperation, a diverse dataset is collected, comprising demonstrations across multiple HRI scenarios, including handshaking, handwaving, payload reception, walking, and walking with a payload. 
                After synchronizing, filtering, and transforming the data, different Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models are trained. 
                The final system integrates different modalities comprising exteroceptive and proprioceptive sources of information to provide the robot with an understanding of its environment and its own actions. 
                The robot takes sequence of images (RGB and depth) and joints state information during the interactions and then reacts accordingly, demonstrating learned behaviors. By fusing multimodal signals in time, we encode new autonomous capabilities into the robotic platform, allowing the understanding of context changes over time. 
                The models are deployed on ergoCub, a real-world humanoid robot, and their performance is measured by calculating the success rate of the robot's behavior under the mentioned scenarios.

                XBG leverages the avatar system <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adh3834">[1]</a> that enables a human operator to embody a humanoid robotic platform. 
                It is composed of two networks: the operator and the robot one, which are connected through diverse teleoperation and teleperception interfaces. 
                Figure 1 shows the operator (left-top) and the robot network (right) connected through the retargeted joints position, walking velocities, and the sensor feedback interface. 
                This work introduces the embodied AI network (left-bottom) where XBG connects to the same interfaces as the operator one allowing to switch from human teleoperation to an embodied AI autonomous behavior 
                (the XBG network architecture is presented in detail in the figure below).

            <h2>XBG model</h2>
            <p>
                In an autonomous humanoid robot system, much like
                humans being aware of their surroundings and actions, it is
                essential for the robot to understand its environment and its
                own actions. To achieve this, we incorporate two components
                into the XBG (eXteroceptive Behaviour Generation) model
                one for processing environmental information (such as what
                the robot sees and senses) and another for understanding
                the robot’s state (like its position, movements, and internal
                conditions). Similar to humans, who do not make decisions
                or act based on a single moment in time but rather consider
                longer context to give a sense to an interaction, the robot
                also needs to understand sequences of events. XBG analyzes
                the images captured by the robot’s cameras and monitor its
                joint positions over time to assess its behaviour. This involves
                observing changes over time, both in visual perception and
                physical movements.
                To this purpose the model comprises 4 primary compo-
                nents that are shown in Figure 2: one for extracting features
                from the environmental sensory inputs (exteroceptive), a
                component to assess its state (proprioceptive), another one
                for integrating these diverse sources of information (modality
                fusion), and the last one for analyzing temporal dependen-
                cies and patterns. These components collaborate to provide
                the robot a comprehensive understanding of how it should
                interact with its surroundings and humans.

            <h3>
                Exteroceptive Component
            </h3>
            <p>
                The exteroceptive component aims at enhancing the
                into its context and learns to respond accordingly. For such
                robot’s perception capabilities. By gathering information
                from the surrounding environment, the robot gains insight
                a task, this work uses both RGB and depth data as shown
                in Figure 2a. Each modality is initially handled by separate
                branches, extracting a set of features from them, that are then
                fused.
                The RGB branch receives input images of size 224x224
                pixels by 3 channels. These images go through a feature
                extraction using a pre-trained model backbone. XBG uses the
                smallest version of YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once Version
                8 nano) <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics">[2]</a>. The purpose of using this pretrained sub-
                network is to leverage its capacity to extract a meaningful
                set of visual features.
                On the other hand, the depth branch employs a series of 7
                standard convolutional layers, each layer uses a 3x3 kernel,
                with stride and padding set to 1, and ReLU activation func-
                tion. The number of channels increase gradually up to 256
                throughout the branch, while its dimensionality is reduced by
                using pooling layers. This branch’s design ensures an output
                with identical dimensions to the RGB branch, facilitating the
                multimodal fusion in subsequent network layers.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Proprioceptive Component
            </h3>
            <p>
                The proprioceptive component plays a crucial role in fur-
                nishing the robot with self-awareness by extracting pertinent
                information regarding its own actions. It encompasses the
                robot’s upper-body joint positions, locomotion velocities (in-
                cluding linear, angular, and sideways velocities), and motor
                currents in the arm joints (shoulders and elbows), which
                provide insight into the effort exerted by these joints. Figure
                3 shows the degrees of freedom of each joint controlled
                by XBG in the upper-body of the robot and the walking
                velocities signal for the walking controller in charge of
                the lower-body joints. These inputs are fed into two fully-
                connected layers, each comprising 512 neurons with ReLU
                activation function, obtaining a robot state feature tensor.

                Fig. 3: XBG proprioceptive input/output signals. XBG 
                receives as input the positions from the upper-body joints,
                motor currents from shoulders and elbows, and walking
                velocities. It outputs the same joints positions for the upper-body 
                and the walking velocities for the walking controller.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Modal Fusion Component
            </h3>
            <p>
                XBG employs a mid-fusion strategy to fuse the various
                modalities within the system (figure 2c), it starts by stacking
                the channels from the RGB and depth branch conforming
                a 7x7x512 tensor which pass through a convolutional layer
                with kernel size of 7. This allows to explicitly provide some
                spatial relationship between the RGB and the depth informa-
                tion and also reduce the dimensionality of the exteroceptive
                component obtaining a 512x1x1 already flattened tensor.
                This tensor contains the exteroceptive features that are
                concatenated with the proprioceptive features, obtaining a
                1024 length tensor that constitutes the whole spatial features
                for a single instant of time.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Temporal Component
            </h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to the exteroceptive and proprioceptive compo-
                nents, the robot possesses a set of spatially related features
                that map the external observation of the environment and the
                internal robot state. To construct a successful autonomous
                system, it’s crucial to account for both spatial and temporal
                dimensions, specifically understanding how the environment
                evolves over time and how the robot reacts accordingly. To
                capture these temporal relationships, XBG utilizes a recur-
                sive neural network layer, specifically a Long Short Term
                Memory (LSTM) with a hidden size of 512 and considers
                a time window of 1.6 seconds during training. Finally, the
                network includes a non-linear fully connected layer followed
                by a linear one, forming the network’s head. This allows us
                to decode the features extracted directly to the joint positions
                for the entire upper body and the locomotion velocities for
                the walking controller in charge of the lower-body of the
                robot.
